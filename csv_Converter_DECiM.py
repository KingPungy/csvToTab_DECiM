Usage:
1. Run this script by executing the run.bat file. 
2. This script will open a file picker dialog that allows you to select a CSV file. 
    1.a The CSV file can contain multiple measurements separated by empty lines.
    1.b The selected file also determines the target directory for the output files.
3. The script will then process the file and create a new text file for each measurement in the CSV file. (these are separated by empty lines in the CSV file, if present).
4. The text files will contain the desired columns from each measurement, separated by tabs ('\t').
5. Each text file will be named 'output_measurement_{measurement_number}-date' where {measurement_number} is a unique number for each measurement.
6. The header row will contain the columns: "Frequency (Hz)", "|Z| (ohms)", "Phase of Z (deg)". as required by the DECiM software.
